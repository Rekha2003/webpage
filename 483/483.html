<H2>ABOUT MYSELF</H2>
        <p>
hi, this is rekha.
          I am a passionate Engineer with a degree in Electronics &
          Communication Engineering. My very first experience with code was at
          the time when I started my own blog. My struggle to customize the blog
          pages introduced me to HTML & CSS. Sooner, the excitment of having the
          power to structure pages on my own sounded amazing and that’s when I
          decided to purse Web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, I learnt Full Stack Development.
          I have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Java, C++ and Data
          Structures. Rational thought process and goal-oriented planning are my
          strengths.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently on the look out for a challenging role to build
          products that make a difference.
